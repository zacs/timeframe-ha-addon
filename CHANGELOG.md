## [2.13.0] - 2026-05-26

### Added
- Favicon, app icons, and web manifest for installable PWA support
- Individual toggles for precipitation and wind events on two-day and three-day templates (previously a single "Show Weather Events" toggle controlled both)
- "Hide Dates" option on two-day template
- "Show Event Times" option on two-day template
- "Hide Current Day After Time" option on two-day template: automatically advances to show tomorrow once the configured time passes (default 6:00 PM)
- Granular weather event toggles now respect the legacy `show_weather_events=false` setting for existing devices
- Visual regression test for TRMNL template rendering

### Changed
- "Show All Events" on compact templates now only includes events explicitly tagged with `timeframe-icon` or `timeframe-kids-icon`; untagged events continue to require an icon to appear
- Device card updated timestamp now reads "Updated <1m ago" when last update was under one minute ago
- Two-day template title wrapping is now suppressed when titles fit on a single line
- Two-day and three-day templates use a compact time format

### Fixed
- Deleting a device from the settings page redirected back to the now-deleted settings URL (404); now redirects to the dashboard with a confirmation notice
- Three-day "Show All Events" was including events that should have been filtered

## [2.12.0] - 2026-05-18

### Added
- Device settings page with full configuration, preview, and screenshot management
- "Configure" button on device cards replaces the dropdown menu
- Live preview on settings page with date/time picker and prev/next day navigation
- Screenshot card with inline regenerate button (async, no page navigation)
- Device rename functionality on settings page
- Per-device event filter: comma-separated keywords to show only matching calendar events
- Precipitation probability percentage shown in precip event labels (e.g. "Rain 0.5\" 60%")
- Toggle to show/hide icons on two-day and three-day templates
- Auto-assign icons option (conditional on show icons being enabled)

### Changed
- Device card footer now shows "Updated X ago" instead of device model name
- Precipitation event threshold lowered from 20% to 10%
- Preview page removed as standalone route; functionality moved into settings page

### Fixed
- Clothing forecast: daily high guardrail prevents shorts recommendation when daily forecast high is below threshold
- Multi-day event denominator: non-daily events spanning multiple days now correctly show "1/2", "2/2" instead of "1/1", "2/1"
- CSS specificity fix for time column padding on two-day template
- Icon padding-left removed on two-day and three-day templates
- Allow `%` character in event summaries (was stripped by sanitization)

## [2.11.0] - 2026-05-16

### Added
- TRMNL X device support
- Clothing forecast (shorts/pants recommendation based on morning temperature)
- "Show all events" option on three-day template
- Weather event times and precipitation/wind ranges shown on three-day template

### Changed
- Three-day template layout: events rendered in a table with times, word-wrap instead of truncation
- Two-day template changed from "2-Day Portrait" to "2-Day" landscape layout
- Daily events now use timezone-aware day boundaries
- `DeviceEvent#all_day?` uses local timezone for midnight checks

### Fixed
- Hourly weather events not rendering when HA reports timestamps with `+00:00` instead of `Z` (e.g. Met.no)
- Precipitation events skipped when integration omits `precipitation_probability` (e.g. Met.no); now falls back to precipitation amount and condition
- Wind events skipped when integration omits `wind_gust_speed` (e.g. Met.no); now falls back to `wind_speed`
- Calendar events with blank UIDs now get a deterministic fallback ID
- Timezone handling for daily event start/end times
- Duplicate icon/label pairs in sensor displays
- Expiring pairing codes
- Setup flow compatibility issues
- Performance loading in production

## [2.10.0] - 2026-05-05

### Added
- Eight-day 1080p display template
- Battery level display on device cards
- Daily precipitation totals (rain/snow) shown on daily weather summary with icons
- Daily max wind gust shown on weather summary when ≥ 20mph

### Changed
- Pairing page moved to `/pair`

### Fixed
- Two-day template alignment; allow hiding dates via device configuration
- Image outline on calendar event attachments
- Realtime display refresh handling improvements
- Precip events with negligible amounts (rounding to 0.0) are no longer shown
- Fixed daily precipitation calculation for snow (snowfallAmount is depth, not liquid equivalent)

_Lots of breaking changes in this release, most notably moving the repository to [https://](https://github.com/timeframe/timeframe)._

### Added
- Token-authenticated display URLs for Visionect devices (`/d/:id?key=...`)
- Signed, expiring screenshot URLs for TRMNL devices (1-minute SGID)
- Rack::Attack rate limiting on display and pairing endpoints
- Device card grid with live preview on dashboard

### Security
